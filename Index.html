    <h1>💡 The Secret to Success.</h1>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man who wanted to become successful. He went to a wise old man known for helping people achieve their goals.

He said, “Sir, I want to be successful like you. Please tell me your secret.”

The old man smiled and said, “Meet me tomorrow morning at the riverbank.”

The next day, the young man arrived early. The old man asked him to walk with him into the water. They walked deeper and deeper, until the water reached the young man's neck. Suddenly, the old man pushed his head underwater and held him there.

The young man struggled, trying to come up for air. After a few seconds, the old man let him go. The young man came out of the water, coughing and gasping.

He shouted, “What are you doing? I could have died!”

The old man calmly replied, “When you were underwater, what did you want the most?”

The young man answered, “Air! I wanted to breathe!”

The old man said, “Exactly. When you want success as badly as you wanted air, you will get it. That is the real secret.”

🧠 Moral of the Story:

Success only comes to those who truly desire it, work for it, and never give up. If your will is strong, nothing can stop you.</p>
